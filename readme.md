## Personal Info

I am currently an undergraduate student in China. I majored in Physics, programming is just my hobby.

I am currently interested in FrontEnd area, including Node.js, Deno, Typescript, vue. And I have some great projects, such as

- [ftp-hope](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/ftp-hope)
- [inNENU Wechat Miniapp](https://github.com/Hope-Studio/inNENU-miniapp)

I am currently looking forward to miniapp and I think that's the next generation of Progressive Web Apps and will be the users' choise for light-weight apps.
