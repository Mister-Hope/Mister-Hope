# Hey everyone, I am Mr.Hope

Mr.Hope is my pen name and I like it.(Also I pretty like my avator)

## Personal Info

I am currently an undergraduate student in China. I majored in Physics, programming is just my hobby.

I am currently interested in FrontEnd area, including Node.js, Deno, Typescript, vue. And I have some great projects, such as

- [vuepress-theme-hope](https://vuepress-theme.mrhope.site/)
- [vuepress-plugin-md-enhance](https://vuepress-md-enhance.mrhope.site/)
- [@mr-hope/vupress-plugin-pwa](https://vuepress-pwa.mrhope.site/)
- [@mr-hope/assert-type](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/assert-type)
- [ftp-hope](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/ftp-hope)
- [inNENU Wechat Miniapp](https://github.com/Hope-Studio/inNENU-miniprogram)

and so on.

I am currently looking forward to miniapp and I think that's the next generation of Progressive Web Apps and will be the users' choise for light-weight apps.
